# CS50x - Week 3: Sort

## Problem to Solve

There are three different sorting algorithms: selection sort, bubble sort, and merge sort. This task is to determine which algorithm is implemented in each of the provided compiled programs.

### Sorting Algorithms Overview

1. **Selection Sort**: 
   - This algorithm iterates through the unsorted portions of a list, selecting the smallest element each time and moving it to its correct position.
  
2. **Bubble Sort**: 
   - Bubble sort compares pairs of adjacent values one at a time and swaps them if they are in the incorrect order. This process continues until the entire list is sorted.

3. **Merge Sort**: 
   - Merge sort recursively divides the list into two halves and then merges the smaller lists back together in the correct order.

### Task Details

1. Analyze the following with the input files:
- `sort1`
- `sort2`
- `sort3`
2. Determine which sorting algorithm is used in each program.
3. Record my finding in `answers.txt`.
