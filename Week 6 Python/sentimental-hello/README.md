# Week 6 :Python

## Overview

This week will diving into Python to complete various projects, including **Rewriting C Projects in Python** and start **New Project**.
This week will started by recreating the following foundational programs from Weeks 1 and 2:

### **Rewriting C Projects in Python**
- **Week 1 Projects**:
  - `hello`: A simple program to greet the user.
  - `credit`: A program to validate credit card numbers.
  - `mario`: A program to print a pyramid similar to the iconic Mario game.

- **Week 2 Project**:
  - `readability`: A program to assess the reading level of text based on the number of words, sentences, and syllables.

### **New Project**
* **DNA**: A program to identify DNA profiles based on Short Tandem Repeats (STRs). Here’s a quick overview of the task:
     *  Objective: Use a DNA sequence to identify the person it belongs to by comparing STR counts.
     *  Concepts: This project will require working with strings, lists, and dictionaries to store and manipulate DNA data.
     *  Skills: You’ll practice reading from files, processing CSV data, and applying algorithmic logic to compare DNA sequences.
