## Overview

**CS50x** is Harvard Universityâ€™s introductory course in computer science and programming, open to all, regardless of prior experience. Taught by David J. Malan, the course covers essential topics such as algorithms, data structures, software engineering, and web development. Students learn languages including C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript through problem sets inspired by real-world fields like cryptography, finance, and gaming.

## Course Content

The course is divided into weekly modules, each focusing on a new core concept in computer science:

- **Week 0:** Scratch - Introduction to programming logic and concepts.
- **Week 1:** C - Basics of programming in C.
- **Week 2:** Arrays - Understanding arrays and matrices.
- **Week 3:** Algorithms - Exploring search methods and sorting algorithms.
- **Week 4:** Memory - Memory management in programming.
- **Week 5:** Data Structures - Introduction to structures like hash tables.
- **Week 6:** Python - Comprehensive Python programming.
- **Week 7:** SQL - Database management and queries.
- **Week 8:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript - Basics of front-end web development.
- **Week 9:** Flask - Creating dynamic web applications with Python and Flask.
- **Week 10:** Cybersecurity - Foundations of cybersecurity, covering encryption, data protection, and secure programming practices.

## Practice Problems / Labs / Problem Sets

Each weekâ€™s assignments are designed to deepen understanding and improve problem-solving abilities:

### Weekly Assignments

- **Week 0 - Scratch:** Introduction to programming concepts by creating interactive projects like games or animations using Scratchâ€™s visual code blocks, emphasizing loops, conditionals, and variables.  
- **Week 1 - C:** Introduction to basic programming exercises, including "Hello," "Mario," and "Credit."
- **Week 2 - Arrays:** Implement scrabble points calculators, a substitution cipher, and text readability tests.
- **Week 3 - Algorithms:** Practice sorting and search algorithms with projects like "Runoff" and "Plurality."
- **Week 4 - Memory:** Learn about memory allocation and manipulation through exercises like "Volume," "Filter," and "Recover."
- **Week 5 - Data Structures:** Work with complex data structures, such as "Inheritance" and "Speller."
- **Week 6 - Python:** Develop applications for DNA profiling to identify DNA belonging.
- **Week 7 - SQL:** Query databases with projects like "Song," "Movies," and "Fiftyville."
- **Week 8 - HTML, CSS, JavaScript:** Create web interfaces with projects such as "Trivia" and "Homepage."
- **Week 9 - Flask:** Link web applications with databases through projects like "Finance."
- **Week 10 - Cybersecurity:** Explore secure coding practices, data encryption techniques, and foundational cybersecurity principles.
- **Final Project:** Showcase the skills that built by developing an original, fully realized application.

## My Final Projects

### CoinStock

**CoinStock** is a web application that allows individuals to quote the prices of cryptocurrencies and stocks, as well as to record their portfolios, including stocks, cryptocurrencies, income, and savings. This project applies the knowledge I gained from the course, including Python, database management, and JavaScript.

## My Views and Gains
Taking CS50 as my first programming course has been amazing! The course breaks down complex concepts into manageable steps, making programming accessible and fun. 
Iâ€™m fascinated by the logic behind coding, and every challenge feels like solving a puzzle. I never imagined learning to code could be so rewarding!
Through this course, I have achieved:

- A **solid understanding of programming fundamentals** in languages such as C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- The **ability to think algorithmically** and solve complex problems efficiently.
- **Experience with key concepts** including algorithm, data structures, memory management, cybersecurity basics, software engineering , and web development.
- **Project-based learning:** Applying theoretical knowledge to real-world inspired projects.

## Useful Resources

- **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)** - A CSS framework for designing responsive websites.
- **[Web3school](https://www.w3schools.com/)** - An online tutorial website providing web development tutorials and references.
- **[W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/)** - Validate and optimize HTML code.
- **[Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)** - Documentation on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Tips for Success

1. **Test with different inputs:** Always verify your functions across various scenarios.
2. **Engage with the community:** Collaborate with other learners to share insights, ask questions, and review code. For example, you can participate in [CS50x â€“ Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/courses/176/discussion/) or join the [Official CS50 Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cs50/?rdt=52426).
3. **Persist through challenges:** CS50x is rigorous; approach each problem with patience and determination.
4. **Practice coding regularly:** Repetition reinforces concepts, so complete as many practice problems as possible.
