#If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Since the audio aura is determined by the average of energy ,valence and danceability.I will first qurery the data of these factors.
And the AVG(energy) is  0.65906 , AVG(valence) is 0.484443 and AVG(danceability) is  0.71646.
As we can see the this user prefer more danceable ,energetic song and less sad songs

#Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
We might need more data for example the times each songs the user played ,the duration of total played time of each songs.
